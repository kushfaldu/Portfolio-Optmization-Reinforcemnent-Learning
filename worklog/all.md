I want to develop a Reinforcement Learning-based stock trading system for the Indian stock market (NSE/BSE). The project should be divided into the following phases:

Phase 1: Data Collection and Setup
- Set up the development environment with necessary Python packages
- Identify and collect Indian stock market data sources (NSE/BSE)
- Create a data pipeline for historical stock data
- Select a diverse set of Indian stocks (e.g., NIFTY 50 or BSE SENSEX components)
- Implement data validation and cleaning procedures

Phase 2: Feature Engineering and Preprocessing
- Implement Indian market-specific technical indicators
- Add market sentiment indicators (if available)
- Include sector-specific features
- Handle Indian market-specific data challenges (e.g., trading hours, holidays)
- Create a robust data preprocessing pipeline

Phase 3: Environment Development
- Design a custom trading environment for Indian markets
- Implement Indian market-specific trading rules and constraints
- Define state space, action space, and reward function
- Add transaction costs and taxes as per Indian regulations
- Implement risk management features

Phase 4: RL Model Development
- Implement and test different RL algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDPG, etc.)
- Design model architecture suitable for Indian market conditions
- Implement training pipeline with proper validation
- Add model checkpointing and logging
- Implement hyperparameter tuning framework

Phase 5: Backtesting and Evaluation
- Develop comprehensive backtesting framework
- Implement performance metrics specific to Indian markets
- Create visualization tools for trading decisions
- Analyze model performance across different market conditions
- Compare against benchmark strategies

Phase 6: Optimization and Deployment
- Optimize model performance
- Implement real-time data integration
- Add monitoring and alerting systems
- Create documentation
- Prepare for potential live trading

For each phase, I need:
1. Detailed requirements and specifications
2. Code structure and implementation guidelines
3. Testing and validation procedures
4. Success criteria and deliverables
5. Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

Please help me implement each phase step by step, starting with Phase 1.
